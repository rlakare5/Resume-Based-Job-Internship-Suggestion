# Resume-Based-Job-Internship-Suggestion
Project Overview
This project is a Python and Streamlit application that suggests relevant jobs and internships based on a user’s resume. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze a resume’s content—such as skills, education, and experience—and recommends suitable opportunities with brief explanations.

Motivation
Many students and job seekers struggle to identify internships or jobs that match their skills and qualifications. This project addresses that challenge by providing personalized, AI-driven suggestions, helping users make informed career decisions quickly.
